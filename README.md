# Freeplay Checkpoint
### Rewind, Save, and Restore Checkpoints in Freeplay, Replays, and Custom Training!
<p align="center"><img src="banner.png" width="350"></p>

## Enhancements in This Version

This version extends the original Freeplay Checkpoint implementation with:

- **Checkpoint boost modes**:
  - Restore the boost amount saved with the checkpoint.
  - Keep unlimited boost while replaying a checkpoint.
  - Start each replay with a custom boost percentage.
- **Checkpoint categories**:
  - Create and select named categories backed by separate checkpoint files.
  - Move individual checkpoints between categories while preserving their lock state.
  - Delete a category while safely moving all of its checkpoints to **Default**.
  - Browse and replay every saved checkpoint through the virtual, read-only **All**
    category.
- **Improved Freeplay overlays**:
  - Display the source category and current checkpoint counter without overflowing
    the screen.
  - Show separate **Checkpoint Saving** and **Checkpoint Replaying** control references
    using the configured controller bindings.
  - Keep checkpoint overlays hidden outside standard Freeplay.
- **Simplified local development**:
  - Build, install, and reload the plugin using the included `build.ps1` script.

**Setup:**

1. Open bakkesmod window (F2 by default)
2. Click "Plugins"
3. Find "Freeplay Checkpoint" in the plugin list on the left.
4. Optional: choose new button bindings.
5. Click "Apply Bindings"

Alternatively, or for KBM users: assign the `cpt_` commands (listed in the Command
Reference section below) as desired in the "Bindings" tab.

It is recommended to disable goal scoring in bakkesmod while using this plugin.

**Building and Installing:**

From PowerShell in the repository root, run:

```powershell
.\build.ps1
```

The script builds the Release x64 plugin and runs the project's BakkesMod post-build
patcher, which installs and reloads the plugin.

**Basic Usage:**

Note: assumes default bindings from above.

1. Start freeplay mode.  Set up a shot.
2. Enter rewind mode by pressing the right thumb stick.
3. Steer left/right to rewind/advance time.
   - While selecting a checkpoint, an on-screen panel shows the current mode and
     a quick reference using your configured controller bindings.
4. When you find a point in time to save, press the Back (or Select or Share) button.
5. Resume driving.
6. Press Back again to return to that checkpoint.
7. Press Back (twice) on a currently frozen checkpoint to delete it.
8. Press left/right on the dpad to navigate between multiple saved checkpoints.

**Command Reference:**

- `cpt_freeze`: activates rewind mode in Freeplay or Custom Training
- `cpt_do_checkpoint`:
  - In rewind mode, not at a saved checkpoint: saves the current state as a checkpoint
  - In rewind mode, at a saved checkpoint: deletes the current checkpoint (press twice)
  - While playing: loads the latest checkpoint
  - In a replay, saves the currently selected car & ball as a checkpoint
- `cpt_prev_checkpoint` / `cpt_next_checkpoint`: loads the previous/next saved checkpoint
- `cpt_rand_checkpoint`: loads a random saved checkpoint
- `cpt_lock_checkpoint`: locks/unlocks the current checkpoint to prevent/allow its deletion.
- `cpt_mirror_state`: when frozen, mirrors car and ball to opposide side of field.
- `cpt_freeze_ball`:
  - In rewind mode: unfreezes the player's car while keeping the ball frozen
  - While playing: freezes the ball without freezing the player's car
- `cpt_copy`\*:
  - In rewind mode: copy the current state to the clipboard
  - While playing: copy the last loaded checkpoint or quick checkpoint to the clipboard
  - In a replay: copy the currently selected car & ball to the clipboard
- `cpt_paste`\*: load a checkpoint from the clipboard as a quick checkpoint

\* - The `cpt_copy` and `cpt_paste` commands can be entered in the F6 console of bakkesmod.

**Settings Reference:**

- **Bindings**:
  - KBM players should manually bind the cpt_ keys in the bindings section.
  - Controller players may hold the button they wish to bind and click the action they
    wish to bind to that button.
  - Recommended: Do *not* bind cpt_checkpoint to the same button as "reset shot".
  - Ignore prev/next/freeze ball when not frozen (recommended):
    - Avoids interfering with bakkesmod default commands.
  - Disable binds in custom training: ignore commands in custom training
  - Disable binds in workshop: ignore commands on workshop maps
  - Reset button loads last checkpoint instead of resetting:
    - If a checkpoint was loaded within the last few seconds (set by this amount),
      the reset shot button will load that checkpoint instead of resetting training.
- **Variance**:
  - When resuming play from frozen, apply randomness to the scenario.
  - **Randomly mirror when loading checkpoint**:
    - Randomly mirrors shots when loading to practice opposite angles.
  - **Load random checkpoint**:
    - When not frozen and `cpt_do_checkpoint` is pressed, load a random checkpoint instead
      of the latest one.
- **Auto-reset checkpoint**:
  - Allows drilling a shot or running through shots like a training pack.
- **Other Options**:
  - **Checkpoint Categories**:
    - Select a category to load its saved shots. New checkpoints are saved to the
      currently selected category.
    - **All** is a read-only combined view of every checkpoint in every category.
      Select a specific category before saving, deleting, or changing a lock.
    - Enter a category name and click **Create and Select Category** to create an
      independent checkpoint file.
    - Enable category deletion and click **Delete Current Category** to move all
      of its checkpoints to **Default**, then remove the category.
    - Select a destination and click **Move Current Checkpoint** to move the
      currently selected shot, including its locked state, into another category.
    - The existing `cpt_filename` value remains compatible when upgrading.
    - The active category is displayed beside the current checkpoint number.
  - **Boost when loading checkpoint**:
    - **Saved at checkpoint** restores the boost amount captured with the checkpoint.
    - **Unlimited** keeps boost full while playing from the checkpoint.
    - **Custom amount** restores the selected boost percentage each time the checkpoint loads.
  - **Delete ALL Shots**:
    - Deletes every saved checkpoint in the current file, even locked shots.  Check the
      "Enable" checkbox first to enable the button - there is no warning or confirmation
      once this is checked.
  - **Show player boost while rewinding**:
    - If set, boost will be shown when rewinding if the player was boosting while recording.
      Does not affect checkpoints.
  - **Clean History**:
    - When rewinding and restoring an old state, deletes history after that restored point.
  - **History Length**: amount of history to save
  - **History Refresh Rate**:
    - Interval between saved state points.  Set small for maximum smoothness in history data,
      but at the possible expense of worse performance.
  - **Debug**:
    - Shows some additional debugging data.  Probably not useful.
    
**Other CVars**
- `cpt_car_frozen`/`cpt_ball_frozen`:
  - These are set by this plugin whenever the car or ball or both are frozen in freeplay.

**Uninstalling:**

To conveniently remove bindings from buttons, click the "Remove Bindings" button
in the settings pane.
